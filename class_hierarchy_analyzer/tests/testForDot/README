# testForDot

Run in class_hierarchy_analyzer folder

This test is to check if a "from . import x" statement is correctly handled

The analyzer should recognize that . refers to the same directory it is and grab the module x to be analyzed. We know it has passed the test if something in x is inherited and in the output, that thing is in a branch with x.py as the filename next to it

$ python3 cha.py tests/testForDot/app2.py -c someClass2
someClass2 (app2.py)

$ python3 cha.py tests/testForDot/app.py -c someClass
someClass (app.py)
└── someClass2 (app2.py)
