# Test 6

Inheriting from multiple classes case
* logically this test case doesn't quite make sense in hindsight, could change naming

$ python3 analyzer/analyzer.py tests/test6/person.py -c Person
Person (person.py)

$ python3 analyzer/analyzer.py tests/test6/employee.py -c Employee
Employee (employee.py)
└── Person (person.py)

$ python3 analyzeranalyzer.py tests/test6/manager.py -c Manager
Manager (manager.py)
├── Person (person.py)
└── Employee (employee.py)
